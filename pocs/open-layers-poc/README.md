# OpenLayers Integration with React POC

## Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the integration of OpenLayers into a React application.

## Research Findings

### Choice of Map Library
We chose OpenLayers for this POC for several reasons:

1. **Open Source**: OpenLayers is a fully open-source library, which allows for greater flexibility and customization.

2. **Rich Feature Set**: OpenLayers offers a comprehensive set of mapping features, including support for various data formats, projections, and interaction models.

3. **React Integration**: While not specifically designed for React, OpenLayers can be easily integrated into React applications using hooks and refs.


### Implementation Results
Our POC successfully demonstrated:

- Basic map integration in a React application
- Use of MapTiler as a tile provider
- User interaction (clicking to select locations)
- Display of clicked coordinates

## Requirements

To run this POC, you'll need:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your system
2. A MapTiler account and API key


## Comparison with Google Maps

While Google Maps is a popular choice, OpenLayers offers several advantages for our use case:

1. **Cost**: OpenLayers is free and open-source, potentially reducing costs for high-volume usage.
2. **Customization**: OpenLayers offers more flexibility in terms of map styles and data sources.
3. **Data Ownership**: With OpenLayers, we have more control over our data and are not tied to Google's ecosystem.
