# Google Maps Integration POC

## Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the integration of Google Maps into a React application using the `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library. The goal was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating interactive maps into our web application.

## Research Findings

### Choice of Map Provider
We chose Google Maps for this POC for several reasons:

1. **Widespread Recognition**: Google Maps is a widely recognized and trusted mapping service, ensuring user familiarity.

2. **Comprehensive API**: The Google Maps JavaScript API offers a rich set of features and customization options.

3. **React Integration**: The `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library, provided by the Google Maps Platform team, offers seamless integration with React applications.

4. **Up-to-Date Data**: Google Maps provides frequently updated map data and satellite imagery.

5. **Scalability**: Google's infrastructure ensures high performance and reliability, even with increased user load.

### Implementation Results
Our POC successfully demonstrated:

- Basic map integration in a React application
- Custom marker placement
- User interaction (clicking to select locations)

## Requirements

To run this POC, you'll need:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your system
2. A Google Cloud Platform account
3. A Google Maps API key

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google Maps API key:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run `npm start` to launch the application

## Conclusion

Based on this POC, we recommend proceeding with Google Maps for our mapping needs. The ease of integration, comprehensive feature set, and reliability make it a strong choice for our project.

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional features such as:
   - Custom styling of map markers
   - Geolocation services
   - Directions and route planning
2. Conduct performance testing with larger datasets
3. Explore additional Google Maps API features that could benefit our specific use case
