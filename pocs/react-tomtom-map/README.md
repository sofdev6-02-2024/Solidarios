# TomTom API Integration with React POC

## Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the integration of the TomTom Maps API into a React application.


## Choice of Map Library
We chose the **TomTom Maps API** for this POC due to:

1. **Accurate and Fresh Maps**: TomTom provides highly accurate, dynamic maps with up-to-date data.
2. **Customization**: TomTom Maps SDK allows for extensive customization to fit various use cases.
3. **User Interaction**: The API supports intuitive interaction models, such as clicking on the map to capture coordinates.

## Implementation Results
Our POC successfully demonstrated:

- Basic map integration in a React application.
- Display of TomTom map.
- Capturing user clicks on the map to display latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Requirements

To run this POC, you'll need:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. A TomTom Developer account and an API key.

## Comparison with Google Map Services

1. **Cost**: TomTom offers competitive pricing, which may be advantageous over Google Maps for certain use cases.
2. **Customization**: TomTom provides a wide range of APIs and customization options.
3. **Privacy and Data**: TomTom places more emphasis on user privacy, with no ties to the Google ecosystem.
